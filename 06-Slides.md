## Principles of Verbal Messages
Messages are denotative and connotative.

### Denotation

*Denotation has to do with the objective meaning of a term, the meaning you would find in a dictionary*


### Connotation
*Connotation is the subjective or emotional meaning that specific speakers or listeners give to a word*

### Snarl words, purr words
*Snarl words, purr words: Do not describe objective realities, but rather express the speaker’s feelings*

**Consequence**

**Intention**

1. Where you stand
>I want you to know that it bothers me.

2. Requests of others

3. Descriptions of how you plan to act in the future
>I want you to know that unless we clear this up now, you shouldn’t expect me ever to lend you anything again.
