## Communication Spirals
*A reciprocating communication pattern in which each person’s message reinforces the others*

 >**A**: *(Mildly irritated)* Where were you? I thought we agreed to meet here a half-hour ago.
 >**B**: *(Defensively)* I’m sorry. I got hung up at the library. I don’t have as much free time as you do.
 >**A**: I wasn’t blaming you, so don’t get so touchy.
 >**B**: Who’s getting touchy? I just made a simple comment.

## Defensiveness: Causes and Remedies
### Face-Threatening Acts
* Messages that seem to challenge the image we want to project
* Defensiveness becomes the process of protecting our presenting self, our face.
